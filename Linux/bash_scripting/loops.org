* Loops in Bash with Linux Commands
** For Loop with Linux Commands
Example:
#+begin_src bash
for file in *.txt; do
  echo "Processing $file"
  wc -l "$file"
done
#+end_src
This script processes all `.txt` files in the current directory and prints the line count for each.

** While Loop with Linux Commands
Example:
#+begin_src bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Creating file_$count.txt"
  touch "file_$count.txt"
  ((count++))
done
#+end_src
This script creates five text files named `file_1.txt` to `file_5.txt`.

** Until Loop with Linux Commands
Example:
#+begin_src bash
until [ -f "stop.txt" ]; do
  echo "Waiting for stop.txt to be created..."
  sleep 2
done
echo "stop.txt detected!"
#+end_src
This script waits until a file named `stop.txt` is created in the current directory and then exits.

** Nested Loops with Linux Commands
Example:
#+begin_src bash
for dir in dir1 dir2; do
  echo "Entering $dir"
  for file in "$dir"/*.log; do
    echo "Archiving $file"
    gzip "$file"
  done
done
#+end_src
This script compresses all `.log` files in `dir1` and `dir2` using `gzip`.
