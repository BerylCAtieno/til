* Introduction to Nginx
  Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is an open-source web server software. It is known for its high performance, scalability, and ability to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.

* Key Features
  - Web Server: Serves static content like HTML, CSS, images, and videos.
  - Reverse Proxy: Forwards client requests to backend servers, improving performance and scalability.
  - Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to balance the load.
  - HTTP Cache: Stores content to improve response times and reduce server load.
  - SSL/TLS Support: Handles secure HTTPS connections for encrypted traffic.

* Nginx Use Cases
  - Static File Serving: Serve static content like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - Application Proxying: Reverse proxy for backend application servers (e.g., Node.js, PHP-FPM, Python).
  - Load Balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability.
  - SSL Offloading: Handle SSL/TLS encryption, offloading the burden from backend servers.

* Architecture
  - Nginx uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which allows it to handle many connections with a small resource footprint.
  - It can handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal memory usage.

* Installation
  To install Nginx on Ubuntu:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nginx
  #+END_SRC

* Basic Configuration Example
  - The main configuration file is typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.
  - A simple server block to serve static files:
  #+BEGIN_SRC nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name example.com;
      
      root /var/www/html;
      index index.html;
      
      location / {
          try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
      }
  }
  #+END_SRC

* Testing Configuration
  - After making changes to the configuration file, test it using:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo nginx -t
  #+END_SRC

* Restarting Nginx
  - To apply the changes, restart Nginx:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  #+END_SRC
