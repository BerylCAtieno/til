** Structs

Structs in Go are somewhat similar to classes in Python, but they don't have methods attached directly to them. They are used to group together variables (called fields) that belong together.

#+BEGIN_SRC Go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a struct
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    // Create an instance of the struct
    p := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
    fmt.Println(p)
}
#+END_SRC

This is like defining a class in Python but without methods:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

p = Person(name="Alice", age=30)
print(p.name, p.age)
#+END_SRC
